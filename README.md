If you made it all the way here, congratulations! A new challenge has arrived though. ðŸ’ª

Time for a technical assignment! Take as much time as you need to deliver your solution, while being reasonable. Please let us know if there are any unexpected delays or reasons why you can't take the test at this time. For any further questions, contact us via you HR contact at our company.

## Instructions
+ Clone this repo
+ Complete this exercise and submit either a zip of the solution or a link to a new repo

+ Show the weather info currently for the input location:
  + Location (ie. Brussels, Belgium)
  + Current weather description (ie. raining)

    + Sunrise/Sunset Time
+ Show basic weather info for the next 7 days on that location

  + Deliver the solution hosted on your favourite cloud service with any appropriate changes you'd feel are relevant for a hosted solution
  + Show the location on a map
